# __About Me...__
👋 Hello, I’m Heejoon Ahn, and I am currently a Data Scientist from Institute of Health System Science at Northwell Health. My main role within my team mainly revolves aroud data cleaning and wrangling, data analysis, and setting up data protocols for N-of-1 research. 
I have a **MS degree** in **Health Data Science**. I graduated my undergraduate institution (**BA**) with a major in **Computational Biology** and minor in **Chemistry**. 
The coding languages I know are...

- R 
- C++
- Python
- SQL
- Java

I have experience in generating Shiny Applications for various business purposes and research projects through R. I have done various regression model analyses with COVID-19 data, cancer research, and research using personalized devices like smartwatches. A lot of the work I do involves using R, Python, and SQL fluidly as needed/requested. I have also taken online certificate courses for Google Cloud Machine Learning Engineering, Machine Learning, and the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, and more!
