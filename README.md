I am currently working as a Senior Data Scientist with 5+ years of experience within the healthcare realm and a background in Computational Biology (B.A.) and Health Data Science (M.S.). I have experience in biostatistics, bioinformatics, data analysis and visualization, data modelling, designing data pipelines, database management, NLP and more. I have contributed in multiple research manuscripts and presented at a conference as well. I am especially passionate about connecting with other Data Scientists as Seattle's Open Data Science Conference Ambassador to learn more about the various AI developments.
