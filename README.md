## Others

I have experience in generating Shiny Applications for various business purposes and research projects through R. I have done various regression model analyses with COVID-19 data, cancer research, and research using personalized devices like smartwatches. A lot of the work I do involves using R, Python, and SQL fluidly as needed/requested. I have also taken online certificate courses for Google Cloud Machine Learning Engineering, Machine Learning, and the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, and more!
